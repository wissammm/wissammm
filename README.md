# Hi, I'm Wissam ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to all my fans (0 fans)! I'm passionate about reinforcement learning, AI, and retro gaming. My focus is on making a path between old console and new technologies (especially AI !)

## Featured Project: PkmnRLArena

[PkmnRLArena](https://github.com/wissammm/PkmnRLArena) aims to create a Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment for PokÃ©mon Emerald using PettingZoo, but the most important part, improve the difficulty of Pokemon Emerald directly inside the GBA with a trained AI. The project involves:
- Building an RL-compatible environment based on PokÃ©mon Emerald gameplay
- Training models to play and optimize strategies for the game
- Running trained models directly on a Game Boy Advance emulator

### Technologies Used
- **Rust**: Core emulator and environment logic
- **Python**: RL agent development, environment integration (PettingZoo)
- **C** : Low-level
- **Makefile, Docker, Assembly, Jupyter Notebook, Jinja**: Supporting components for development and experimentation

## About Me
- ðŸ§  Interested in AI, RL, and automation
- ðŸŽ® Love classic video games and emulation
- ðŸ’» Explore the intersection of machine learning and game development
